# Active Context: Smart Daily Planner

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status

- **Phase**: Initial development setup and memory bank initialization
- **Current Task**: Setting up foundational documentation and project structure
- **Development Stage**: Pre-implementation planning and architecture definition

### Recent Changes

1. **Memory Bank Initialization** (Current session)
   - Created `projectbrief.md` - Foundation document with vision and requirements
   - Created `productContext.md` - Product rationale and user experience goals
   - Created `techContext.md` - Technology stack and technical constraints
   - Created `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns and design decisions
   - Currently creating `activeContext.md` - This document for current state tracking

### Current Application State

- **App.tsx**: Contains minimal placeholder implementation (`<h1>hedllo</h1>`)
- **Project Structure**: Basic Vite + React + TypeScript setup is complete
- **Dependencies**: Core dependencies installed (React 19, TypeScript, Vite, ESLint)
- **Configuration**: All config files present and functional
- **Development Environment**: Ready for development (`npm run dev` works)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps (Post Memory Bank)

1. **Fix the typo in App.tsx** - "hedllo" should be "Hello" or proper application content
2. **Install Tailwind CSS** - Set up the utility-first CSS framework
3. **Create basic project structure** - Set up the planned folder structure from README
4. **Implement basic dashboard layout** - Create the main application shell

### Short-term Development Plan

1. **UI Foundation**

   - Install and configure Tailwind CSS
   - Create basic component structure (components/, hooks/, types/, etc.)
   - Build main application shell/layout
   - Implement responsive design foundation

2. **Task Management Core**

   - Create Task interface/types
   - Build TaskList component
   - Build TaskItem component
   - Implement basic CRUD operations (local state first)
   - Add task creation form

3. **Notes Integration**
   - Create Note interface/types
   - Build NotesSection component
   - Implement note creation and editing
   - Integrate with task management

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Backend Integration**

   - Set up Supabase project
   - Configure authentication
   - Implement API service layer
   - Add real-time synchronization

2. **AI Features**
   - Research AI service integration options
   - Implement basic suggestion system
   - Add productivity insights
   - Create analytics dashboard

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Simplicity First**: Prioritizing clean, minimal UI over feature richness
2. **TypeScript Everywhere**: Full type coverage for maintainability
3. **Modern React Patterns**: Hooks-only approach, no class components
4. **Real-time by Design**: Planning for live updates from the beginning

### Technical Considerations

1. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Need to configure with Vite properly
2. **State Management**: Start with React Context, consider external library later if needed
3. **Form Handling**: Use controlled components with custom validation hooks
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error boundaries early

### User Experience Priorities

1. **Speed**: Fast task creation and editing must be priority #1
2. **Intuitiveness**: Interface should be immediately understandable
3. **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design approach
4. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Patterns Established

- **Functional Components**: All components use function syntax with hooks
- **TypeScript First**: Define types before implementation
- **Import Organization**: Use absolute imports and barrel exports
- **Component Structure**: Separate logic (hooks) from presentation (JSX)

### Development Preferences

- **Testing**: Test-driven development for critical paths
- **Git Workflow**: Feature branches with conventional commits
- **Code Quality**: ESLint rules enforced, clean code principles
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and inline documentation

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Project Architecture Insights

1. **Memory Bank Strategy**: Excellent for maintaining context across sessions
2. **React 19 Benefits**: Latest features provide performance and DX improvements
3. **Vite Configuration**: Superior build tool for React development
4. **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety enables confident refactoring

### Product Development Insights

1. **AI Integration Complexity**: Need to balance intelligence with simplicity
2. **Real-time Requirements**: Critical for multi-device usage patterns
3. **Performance Constraints**: Mobile users expect fast, responsive interactions
4. **Feature Scope**: Start minimal, expand based on user feedback

### Technical Insights

1. **Supabase Integration**: Powerful backend-as-a-service for rapid development
2. **Component Design**: Atomic design principles scale well for productivity apps
3. **State Management**: React Context sufficient for initial version
4. **Build Optimization**: Vite provides excellent development experience

## Current Challenges and Considerations

### Technical Challenges

1. **AI Integration**: How to make suggestions genuinely helpful without being intrusive
2. **Real-time Sync**: Handling conflicts and offline scenarios gracefully
3. **Performance**: Maintaining responsiveness with large task lists
4. **Cross-device UX**: Consistent experience across different screen sizes

### Product Challenges

1. **Feature Creep**: Maintaining focus on core daily planning use case
2. **User Onboarding**: Making first-use experience immediately valuable
3. **Competitive Differentiation**: Standing out in crowded productivity app market
4. **Privacy Concerns**: Handling user data transparently and securely

### Development Process

1. **Scope Management**: Balancing comprehensive features with timely delivery
2. **Quality Standards**: Maintaining high code quality while moving quickly
3. **User Feedback**: Getting early user input without premature optimization
4. **Documentation**: Keeping documentation current with rapid development

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files to Review

- `src/App.tsx` - Current minimal implementation needs expansion
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts overview
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation and vision
- `memory-bank/` - All memory bank files for full context

### Current State Summary

- Project is in very early stage with basic setup complete
- Comprehensive planning and architecture documentation is established
- Ready to begin actual feature implementation
- Need to start with basic UI and component structure before moving to advanced features

### Important Context

- This is a learning project focused on modern React development
- Emphasis on clean code, good architecture, and comprehensive documentation
- Balance between ambitious features (AI integration) and practical implementation
- Priority on creating genuinely useful daily planning tool, not just another todo app
