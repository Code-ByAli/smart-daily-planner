- **Documentation**: Comprehensive (memory bank system established)
- **Code Quality**: Good (ESLint configured, minimal code so far)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Current Session)

1. **Memory Bank Approach**: Decided to implement comprehensive documentation system for context preservation
2. **React 19**: Committed to latest React version for modern features
3. **TypeScript First**: Full type coverage from the beginning
4. **Vite Over CRA**: Superior development experience and build performance
5. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development

### Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Component Architecture**: Functional components with hooks only
2. **State Management**: Start with React Context, upgrade if needed
3. **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints with Supabase integration
4. **Real-time Strategy**: WebSocket-based live updates planned
5. **Testing Strategy**: Plan for comprehensive testing, TDD for critical paths

### Design Principles Established

1. **Simplicity First**: Clean, minimal UI over feature complexity
2. **Performance Focus**: Fast interactions prioritized
