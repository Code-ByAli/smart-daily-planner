## Current Status

### Development Stage

**Phase**: Pre-implementation setup and planning
**Status**: Memory bank initialization complete, ready for feature development
**Priority**: Immediate focus on basic application structure and Tailwind CSS setup

### Technical Debt

- **App.tsx Typo**: Minor issue that needs quick fix
- **Missing Tailwind**: Critical for UI development
- **No Component Structure**: Needs organized folder hierarchy
- **No Type Definitions**: Need to establish core interface definitions

### Quality Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 0% (no tests written yet)
- **Type Coverage**: ~90% (basic TypeScript setup)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive (memory bank system established)
- **Code Quality**: Good (ESLint configured, minimal code so far)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Current Session)

1. **Memory Bank Approach**: Decided to implement comprehensive documentation system for context preservation
2. **React 19**: Committed to latest React version for modern features
3. **TypeScript First**: Full type coverage from the beginning
4. **Vite Over CRA**: Superior development experience and build performance
5. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development

### Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Component Architecture**: Functional components with hooks only
2. **State Management**: Start with React Context, upgrade if needed
3. **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints with Supabase integration
4. **Real-time Strategy**: WebSocket-based live updates planned
5. **Testing Strategy**: Plan for comprehensive testing, TDD for critical paths

### Design Principles Established

1. **Simplicity First**: Clean, minimal UI over feature complexity
2. **Performance Focus**: Fast interactions prioritized
3. **Accessibility**: Built-in support for keyboard navigation and screen readers
4. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design from the beginning
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works offline

## Known Issues

### Current Issues

1. **App.tsx Typo**: "hedllo" instead of proper content
2. **Missing Tailwind**: Blocks UI development progress
3. **No Folder Structure**: Components need proper organization
4. **Basic Placeholder App**: Needs real application shell

### Potential Future Issues

1. **AI Integration Complexity**: Balancing helpfulness with simplicity
2. **Real-time Sync Conflicts**: Handling offline-online transitions
3. **Performance with Large Lists**: Need virtualization for scalability
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensuring modern features work everywhere
